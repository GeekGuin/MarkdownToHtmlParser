# MarkdownToHtmlParser
A markdown to html parser using the [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) markdown to html parser and code from
[here](https://github.com/chjj/marked/pull/238/files?short_path=04c6e90). Basically this is just a html with those files ready to  use and the emojis already on the project folders!

Basically this supports everything that the [GitHub Markdown supports](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
but the task lists!
